# Resume Generator

Helping users create high-impact, industry-standard resumes that pass ATS filters and wow recruiters.

## When to use this skill
- User says: "Help me create a resume for a [Job Title] role."
- User provides their LinkedIn/CV and says: "Optimize this for [Target Job Description]."
- User needs a targeted cover letter for a specific application.

## Workflow
1. [ ] **Information Gathering**: Collect user's current CV, target job description (JD), and any specific accomplishments not in their existing docs.
2. [ ] **JD Analysis**: Extract key skills, keywords, and responsibilities from the target JD using a "Keyword Heatmap" approach.
3. [ ] **Drafting - The Foundation**: 
    - Create a punchy "Professional Summary" (3-4 lines).
    - Re-write bullet points using the **Google XYZ Formula** (Accomplished [X] as measured by [Y], by doing [Z]).
4. [ ] **ATS Optimization**: Ensure all critical keywords from the JD are naturally integrated.
5. [ ] **Formatting & Layout**: Suggest a clean, one-page layout (using templates in resources).
6. [ ] **Cover Letter (Optional)**: Draft a matching cover letter that tells a story the resume can't.

## Instructions

### 1. The "Google XYZ" Bullet Point Rules
Every bullet point must follow:
- Start with a strong action verb (Spearheaded, Orchestrated, Engineered).
- Include a metric (20% increase, 500+ users, $10k savings).
- Describe the tool/method used.

### 2. ATS Compatibility Check
- Avoid multi-column layouts unless specifically requested.
- Prioritize standard headings: "Work Experience," "Education," "Skills."
- Ensure dates are consistently formatted.

### 3. Tailoring Strategy
- Identify the "Top 3 Problems" the company is trying to solve (based on the JD).
- Front-load the resume with evidence that the user has solved those exact problems.
